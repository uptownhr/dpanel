#Dpanel
Dpanel makes hosting websites incredibly simple.
Think of it as cPanel, DirectAdmin, MAMP/WAMP style control panel, but with Docker technology. 
You can run multiple sites with unique domains that automatically maps to your containers.


##Get Started
1. docker pull uptownhr/dpanel
2. docker run —-name=dpanel i -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock uptownhr/dpanel /bin/bash

##How to use
1. Remote into your Dpanel, run ```docker attach dpanel```
2. ```dpanel start myblog.com```
By default, dpanel creates a container with a wordpress image.
To specify another, just pass the -i flag (ie; dpanel start -i somerepo/someimage)
3. ```dpanel stop myblog.com```
Stops the container
4. ```dpanel delete myblog.com```
Deletes the container
5. ```dpanel list```
Lists all the running containers
